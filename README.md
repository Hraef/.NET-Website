## What I Used
This project was deployed to Azure using Terraform. The configuration is for a Linux web app using Dotnetcore -6.0 as it's runtime Stack. The web app is configured to use a custom domain that I bought from 

https://www.namecheap.com/

the architecture for the Azure resources has a resource group that conssists of a app service plan and a web app.

Github Actions is being used for the CI/CD.

The Template of the website was orginally created by Ceevee from
